Project Descriptions : 

    1. Use of system calls in a simple concatentation program

        The objective of this assignment is to write a simple C program which is invoked from the command line in a UNIX
        environment, to utilize the UNIX system calls for file I/O, and to properly handle and report error conditions

    2. Recursive filesystem lister
    
        Write a program in C which uses the directory exploration library functions such as readdir to produce a recursive
        directory listing which is similar to the output of find /starting_directory -ls
        
    3. Simple Shell Program
    
        Write an extremely simplistic UNIX shell which is capable of launching one program at a
        time, with arguments, waiting for and reporting the exit status and resource usage statistics
          
    4. Experiments with Pipes and Signals
      
        The code you will write for the 2 problems below will be an "experiment" to test for certain properties of pipes 
        and signals. Develop a test program to determine the capacity of a pipe and behavior of "real time" & non-"real 
        time" signal. 
          
    5. mmap test programs
          
        A sophisticated programming technique is to create "test programs" which probe for the existence of certain features
        on a target platform, or which "prove" that something works a certain way. Create test programs to discover the answers
        to a variety of questions having to do with the virtual memory system and the mmap system call. 
    
    6. A multi-layered synchronization programming problem
    
        Explore synchronization issues on a simulated multi-processor, shared-memory environment. You will build a spinlock 
        primitive using an atomic TAS instruction, then use that, along with signals which simulate interrupts, to build a 
        semaphore library implementing the basic P,V and TRY operations. Finally, you will stress-test your semaphore library 
        by an exercise establishing multiple simultaneous invocations of the P and V operations on the same semaphores.
     
    7. Assemble your own cat
    
        In this problem, you will be writing a pure assembly language program that makes system calls, and examining its
        operation using the strace utility program, which allows you to run a program with system call tracing enabled.
